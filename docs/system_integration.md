The WebIntegrationTool provides web browser automation and content retrieval.

**Features:**
- Open URLs in default browser
- Get content from web pages
- Extract titles and text content

**Security:**
- Requires `WEB_ACCESS` with `BROWSER` permission
- Validates URLs against allowed domains
- Respects user-configured security policies

### 6. API Integration Tool

The APIIntegrationTool enables integration with various web services and APIs.

**Features:**
- Generic API requests (GET, POST, etc.)
- Placeholder implementations for email, calendar, cloud storage
- Rate limiting and request validation

**Security:**
- Requires `API_ACCESS` with `NETWORK` permission
- Validates endpoints against allowed patterns
- Implements rate limiting

### 7. Plugin Manager

The PluginManager provides an extensible architecture for adding new integrations.

**Features:**
- Dynamic plugin loading
- Plugin registration
- Plugin execution framework

**Security:**
- Requires `PLUGIN_MANAGER` permissions
- Validates plugin paths against allowed directories

## Configuration

The system integration features are configured through `config/system_integration.yaml`. The main configuration sections include:

### Application Discovery Settings
- `enabled`: Whether application discovery is enabled
- `scan_paths`: Directories to scan for applications
- `allowed_extensions`: File extensions considered as applications

### File System Integration Settings
- `enabled`: Whether file system integration is enabled
- `allowed_directories`: Directories the AGI can access
- `max_file_size_mb`: Maximum file size for operations
- `allowed_file_operations`: Types of file operations permitted

### Terminal Integration Settings
- `enabled`: Whether terminal integration is enabled
- `allowed_commands`: List of commands that can be executed
- `blocked_patterns`: Command patterns that are blocked
- `max_execution_time`: Maximum time for command execution

### System Monitor Settings
- `enabled`: Whether system monitoring is enabled
- `collection_interval_seconds`: How often to collect metrics
- `threshold_percent`: Resource usage thresholds for alerts

### Web Integration Settings
- `enabled`: Whether web integration is enabled
- `allowed_domains`: Domains the AGI can access
- `blocked_domains`: Domains that are blocked
- `max_page_size_kb`: Maximum web page size to retrieve

### API Integration Settings
- `enabled`: Whether API integration is enabled
- `rate_limit_requests_per_minute`: API request rate limiting
- `allowed_endpoints`: Endpoints the AGI can access
- `max_request_size_kb`: Maximum request size

### Plugin Manager Settings
- `enabled`: Whether plugin management is enabled
- `allowed_directories`: Directories where plugins can be loaded
- `auto_reload`: Whether to auto-reload plugins
- `security_validation`: Whether to validate plugins for security

## Security Model

The system integration framework implements a comprehensive security model:

1. **Permission System**: Each operation requires specific permissions that are validated before execution
2. **Path Validation**: File system operations are validated against allowed directories
3. **Command Validation**: Terminal commands are validated against allowed commands and blocked patterns
4. **URL Validation**: Web operations are validated against allowed and blocked domains
5. **Risk Assessment**: High-risk operations are assessed and may require user consent
6. **User Consent**: Critical operations require explicit user consent
7. **Audit Logging**: All operations are logged for security review

## Usage Examples

### Discovering Applications
```python
app_discovery = ApplicationDiscoveryTool(security_manager)
result = app_discovery.run(action="list_installed_apps")
print(result)
```

### File System Operations
```python
file_tool = FileSystemIntegrationTool(security_manager)
result = file_tool.run(action="list_directory", path="~/Documents")
print(result)
```

### Terminal Commands
```python
terminal_tool = TerminalIntegrationTool(security_manager)
result = terminal_tool.run(command="ls -la", timeout=10)
print(result)
```

### System Monitoring
```python
monitor = SystemResourceMonitor(security_manager)
result = monitor.run(action="get_system_info")
print(result)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only the minimum permissions necessary for operations
2. **Regular Security Reviews**: Periodically review and update security configurations
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor logs for unusual or suspicious activities
4. **Testing**: Test new integrations in a safe environment before production use
5. **User Awareness**: Keep users informed about AGI activities through transparent reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Permission Denied Errors
- Verify that the required permissions are granted in the security configuration
- Check that paths are in the allowed directories list
- Ensure the security manager is properly initialized

### Command Execution Failures
- Verify that the command is in the allowed commands list
- Check that the command doesn't match any blocked patterns
- Ensure the terminal integration is enabled

### Web Access Issues
- Verify that the domain is in the allowed domains list
- Check that the domain is not in the blocked domains list
- Ensure the web integration is enabled

## Extending the System

New integrations can be added by:
1. Creating a new tool class that inherits from BaseTool
2. Implementing appropriate security validations
3. Adding configuration options to the system integration config
4. Registering the tool in the main application

The plugin architecture allows for dynamic addition of new capabilities without modifying the core system.
